Timus is a command line tool for automating tasks in writing problems of TimusOJ, the Online Judge system.

For ACM ICPC problems, see the official timusOJ website http://acm.timus.ru/

This cli tool helps you create and manage your timus local project directory.

You can make the project folder a git repo, write sub problems, have quick access to problems sets lists in the website, and automatically make/submit your solutions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'timus'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install timus

## Usage

This project is under basic setup development, so now it is not functionable.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
